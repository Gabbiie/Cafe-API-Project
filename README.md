# Cafe-API-Project
A REST API service built with Flask and Postman. Contains a database of cafes in a particular city, which are suitable for remote work. Provides details about each cafe
such as the amenities available. Users can make GET, PUT, PATCH and DELETE HTTPS requests to the API. A delete request is successful only if it is made with a certain 
API key.
